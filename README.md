# PathPlanningAlgorithms
It is a platform that implements some path planning algorithms.

Main dependence: python3.7, opencv4.1.1.26 (for image show) 

Tips: python3.8 is not recommended due to some incompatible packages.

## draft.py 
This file can be regarded as a draft paper. To be honest, I am not so familiar with Python, so I use this file to test if my code has any grammar bugs, pointers bugs or something like that.

## tree_print.py 
This is a file that can print the structure of the platform, which is recorded in tree.txt.

The rest of the platform is environment establishment and planning algorithm implementation.

Currently, there are some algorithms already implemented in this platform, including:

### Search based:
Dijkstra, A-Star, Jump Point Star

### Sampling based:
RRT, RRT_Connect, RRT_Star, RRT_Smart, RRT_Connect_Smart, RRT_Star_Smart

More algorithms will be put into it in the future(^_^), any advice and visit are welcomed~~~
